My Glam Bag Rails App
by Nana Nkansah-Siriboe

# How To Set Up the App

Visit my Github repository and clone the code to your local directory:
git clone https://github.com/nanaama527/glam-bag.git

Enter into the glam-bag folder: cd glam-bag.
Execute bundle install and run rails s in terminal.
Then, open your browser at http://localhost:3000/.

# How To Use the App

You can either sign up for your own account or use the existing accounts to log in (You can also sign in via your Google account).

Before logging in, you still can see a user list aand their glam bags listed with them, but you are unable to make reservations.

If you log in as normal user (test@users.com, password: 123), you can create, update, and delete your own glam bag.

Each user has access to his/her own profile (user info, bag info, add to bag option) through the link displayed on the page.
